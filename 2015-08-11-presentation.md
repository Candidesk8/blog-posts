uCoin is a _cryptocurrency software_, which mean it is a **sotfware** providing the ability to **create currencies**. uCoin is different from other cryptocurrency softwares you may know (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, ...) for 2 main reasons : its **currency code** which includes both [Universal Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit) & [Web of Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) concepts, but also its **Blockchain code** which is far more energy efficient, putting away this massive energy waste introduced by Bitcoin.

## Outline

> **Any member is co-producer of the money** without doing anything, just for being a human of the monetary Community.

This is where money comes from: every member regularly receives a Universal Dividend (i.e. monetary Basic Income) coming from new money directly issued by members and to members.

> **Any member needs signatures from other members** to join in or simply stay in the Community.

Every member is _strongly identified_ through a Web of Trust mechanism to avoid one individual to receive multiple Universal Dividend through multiple identities. This implies a regular and renewed recognition of each member's identity so we are confident each individual is real and alive.

> **Data is fully distributed through the P2P network** to avoid any central power highly subject to corruption or Single Point of Failure issues.

Data is fully managed by the _P2P network_ so a free currency does not fall under few hands control and can stay a free currency.

## A bit more

### Money is co-produced by all the community members

This is the really main feature: money is _equally_ co-produced by the members of the community (a.k.a Web of Trust (WoT)). Such an equality is ensured in both space and time so that newcomers won't be excluded from money production process [like it can be seen with Bitcoin](http://magazine.ouishare.net/2013/05/bitcoin-human-based-digital-currency/), therefore **it won't be needed to create yet another Bitcoin currency to have your part of brand new money**. This co-production implies members to be identified in the software, and thus a mechanism to avoid people being able to create fake accounts for producing more money than others.

### No more CPU race: an energy efficient Blockchain

Classical blockchains uses CPU power for addressing security issues. Even if it works (at least, it seems to), this is a very energy costly process. uCoin bet it is possible to have a similar but _more efficient_ _process_, which is not the little brother Proof-of-Stake (the power by the richers). uCoin benefits from a particular resource to reach this goal: **its identified community, its members**. Here is how uCoin Blockchain is built: each block is computed exclusively by members. Which means neither super Google nor any super powered group would be able to control the chain. Moreover, uCoin adds a rotation rule meaning **a member cannot control the blockchain alone**. A group of users could, but this would imply their computing power to be higher than the whole remaining members of the network. This is where Web of Trust comes into place: each member is recognized (its identity is trusted - not its acts) if he fits the WoT rules:

*   the members must have enough signatures (links) from other members
*   the member is close enough from any other member

given the facts that:

*   signatures expire (the have a validity duration)
*   a given link must see a delay before being replayed
*   a member must wait a delay between each signature he makes (like a week)
*   a member have a limit in the number of links he can make to others
*   links cannot be made in the future
*   links cannot be made too far in the past

These rules are what reasonably ensures very most of the WoT is composed of unique and living individuals. Depending on the currency parameters, these rules may become either very hard or very easy to pass. For example, if each member must be directly signed by every other member (distance = 1), then it won't be possible to have fake accounts (unless everyone agrees with that). But such a community would be small. In the opposite, a distance of 5 would mean it exists a path of 5 links between 2 members (from one to the other). This would be much easier, making a wider community, but making fake accounts easier too. This is all a matter of which parameters are used for which maximum community size.
