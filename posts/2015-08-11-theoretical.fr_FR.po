"uCoin uses the crypto-currency concept introduced by Bitcoin, which is to "
"use cryptography features such as _signature_ to create digital "
"currencies. uCoin fits in this definition, however it has completely "
"different fundation principles than Bitcoin like Web of Trust and Universal "
"Dividend to do _really_ better than Bitcoin. Actually, uCoin has a "
"theoretical reference called [Relative Money Theory "
"(french)](http://wiki.creationmonetaire.info/). This theory **demonstrates** "
"that a currency which aims at respecting each individual's economic "
"liberties MUST implement the Universal Dividend (aka. _Basic Income_), which "
"is the only way to avoid both spatial and temporal asymmetry toward money "
"issuance."

"... we would answer this work _shouldn't have been rewarded by newly created "

"should be rewared another way, not by money issuance. Of course, Bitcoin "
"can't create money through Basic Income since Bitcoin users are not strongly "

"Bitcoin has a planned limit of 21 million BTC, which means less and less "
"bitcoins will be created over the time until 0 remains. So, once first "
"adopters will have mined every bitcoin, how will future joiners do to get "
"bitcoins? Answer is: just like Euros or Dollars. To get money you have to "
"work for the ones who already own it. **We believe this is the second "
"injustice.** Every member of a monetary community should be equal towards "
"money issuance, and get the same relative amount of new money over the time, "
"_even if he is a later adopter_. uCoin aims at fixing this bug too by making "
"Universal Dividend _grow by the time_ according to precise rules allowing "
"members equality toward money issuance on a half-lifespan."

"Idea is the following: Bitcoin has teached us _it is possible_ to create a "
"currency system allowing both to create digital money and to exchange it "
"without central authority. What we need to change is _the way money is "
"issued_ so we finally has a symmetrical system. We need Bitcoin + Universal "
"Dividend. But Universal Dividend _implies_ to have a community of identified "
"people. This is where Web of Trust (WoT) comes into place: this concept, "
"introduced by cryptography with OpenPGP format, allows us to identify people "
"in a decentralized manner. It works this way: each one creates _a personal "
"identity_, linked to its cyptographical certificate, which has to be "
"confirmed by others members using their own cryptographic key. It is that "
"simple: **people define by themselves who is part of the community and who "
"is not.**"
