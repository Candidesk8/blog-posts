# Try our testing currency!

We provide you a testing currency named **GTest**. This currency is alive, being actively used by us and some regular testers.

You can also try it: we wrote a [tutorial](https://forum.duniter.org/t/join-the-gtest-currency/1620) you need to follow to join the community and use the currency.

> N.B.: this tutorial requires some basic IT skills to be followed: downloading software, extracting it from a compressed folder and understanding that the software will connect to the internet.

> This is no big deal for most people, but we prefer that you be warned!

Once your subscription is finalized, you will automatically produce new money on a daily basis. You *do not need to have any software running* for this to occur. The network will perform this task by its own. This is a rule of the currency.

Finally you can play with the software to handle your wallets, transfer money and certify people!

Enjoy this little taste of future!
