# Contact

You have several ways to contact us. Below is a non-exhaustive list of how to contact us, for which purpose.
## General contact

### The forum

This is the most common way to get in touch with us. Go to [forum.duniter.org](http://forum.duniter.org), subscribe and you will be able to create a subject or answer to an existing one.

We prefer this platform for questions since topics are indexed by Search Engines like Google and are made easy to access future newcomers..

### The Chat

We use Jappix XMPP chatroom [duniter@muc.jappix.com](duniter@muc.jappix.com) for chatting. You can connect using your favorite XMPP client like [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) or [Psi+](http://psi-plus.com/), or you can use or widget at the bottom of the page:

This widget, Jappix Mini, is very easy to use for a quick chat. But for a more comfortable chat session, we definitely advice you either to install a client like Pidgin or Psi+, or to connect through [Jappix](https://jappix.com/?l=fr) website.
### The Mailing list

We also have a mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=fr#!forum/duniter

This list was our place to discuss at the beginning and has been replaced by the forum since. Yet, it will be used for major anouncement thereafter.
