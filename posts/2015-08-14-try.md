# Try our testing currency!

Even if uCoin is still in a development phase, you can already have a try on it, *today*.

We provide you a testing currency named **meta_brouzouf**. This currency is alive, being actively used by a dozen of people you can interact with to get used to this new kind of currency.

For that purpose, we wrote a [tutorial](http://forum.ucoin.io/t/subscribing-to-meta-brouzouf-testing-currency/199) you need to follow to join the community and use the currency.

> N.B.: this tutorial requires some basic IT skills to be followed: downloading a software, extracting it from a compressed folder and understanding that the software will connect to the internet.

> This is no big deal for most people, but we prefer you to be warned!

Once your subscription is finalized, you will automatically produce new money on a daily basis. You *do not need to have any software running* for this to occur. The network will perform this task by its own. This is a rule of the currency.

Finally you can play with the software to handle your wallets, transfer money and certify people!

Enjoy this little taste of future!
