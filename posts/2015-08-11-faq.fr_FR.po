"uCoin protocol will use Graph Theory properties to build a Web of Trust of "
"unique & living individuals. Even if uCoin team is made up of "
"engineers/PhDs, Graph Theory is not something easy and we probably need "
"experts in that domain. So, if Graph Theory is your every day life, **do not "
"hesitate to come to us!**"

"Well, if reached this paragraph reading the whole FAQ, you should have a "
"rather good idea of what is uCoin. You could go deeper with [Theoretical "
"section](http://ucoin.io/theoretical). From there, you should be able to "
"talk about the project with a minimum of background. If you want to get "
"deeper in uCoin, read [UCP](http://ucoin.io/specs), this is uCoin "
"protocol. All what you need to know about technical IT stuff is there, even "
"if not in a tutorial format. Last, you could try to read "
"[RMT](http://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Th%C3%A9orie_relative_de_la_monnaie), which "
"is the fundamental theory behind uCoin's way of creating new money."
