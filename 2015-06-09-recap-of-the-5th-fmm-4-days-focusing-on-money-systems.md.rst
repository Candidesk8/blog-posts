There we are! **5th FMM is now over**. It has been `a very rich
experience of 4
days <http://blog.ucoin.io/ucoin-at-the-5th-freedom-money-meeting/>`__ focusing
on money systems. Below is quick recap of what happened during these
days for those of you who could not be here with us! ## First day: a
dive into uCoin protocol

The very first day was a presentation made by your servitor (cgeek)
about uCoin software & protocol. This was a travel across technical
details about how is uCoin working, which are the rules and what is the
life of currency propulsed by uCoin protocol.

The presentation was in French, but I took the time to translate it in
case you wanted to read it. You can dowload the file
here: \ `FMM5\_Presentation\_en </files/FMM5_Presentation_en.odp>`__.

Second day: more about CuteCoin & uCoinApps softwares!
------------------------------------------------------

This day was an opportunity for client softwares to be presented. Let's
see the two firsts: *CuteCoin* and *uCoinApps*. ### Cutecoin

The morning was dedicated to
`Cutecoin <https://github.com/ucoin-io/cutecoin>`__, the very first
client of uCoin software. We steped through:

-  Current state of the application
-  Work to be done
-  Development process (unit tests, continuous integration)
-  And incoming features

Currently, Cutecoin allows you to do all the core operations made
possible by uCoin software. It is also the first allowing to have an
overview of the network!

uCoinApps
~~~~~~~~~

The afternoon was dedicated to uCoinApps, the little brother of Cutecoin
as it is the second client for uCoin. uCoinApps is an Android
application that allows you to:

-  Connect to an existing currency network
-  Create your personal account
-  Publish your identity
-  Certificate other members
-  See your account's balance
-  Transfer money

The application is available on `Google
Play <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ucoin.ucoin>`__.
You may also find `a tutorial
(french) <http://www.ucoin.fr/utiliser/ucoinapps-android/>`__ for using
it at `ucoin.fr <http://ucoin.fr>`__.

Third day: simulation of 160 years of money systems
---------------------------------------------------

This day was an opportunity for non-developers to discover a french game
called `La
Corbeille <http://www.valeureux.org/blog/les-jeux/jeu-la-corbeille/>`__.
This game consists in simulating an **economy** by producing values
using the only available currency system. The goal is to understand the
underlying code of a currency system and see the consequences of using
it. During this session, we have tried 2 money systems:

-  Debt Money system (the one used by almost all currencies over the
   world, including € and $) in the morning
-  Freedom Money system (the one used by uCoin) in the afternoon

The results of this session are available for download
on GitHub: \ `LibreOffice Calc
file <https://github.com/galuel/Geconomicus/raw/master/Exemple_de_suivi_tableur.ods>`__.
Also, you can access
the project \ `Ğeconomicus <https://github.com/galuel/Geconomicus>`__
which provides a set of free graphics & tools to create your own economy
simulations based on 80 years human lifetime. Here is a recap video of
this journey (french), so as another resume on
`creationmonetaire.info <http://www.creationmonetaire.info/2015/06/video-geconomicus-la-corbeille-aux-5emes-rencontres-des-monnaies-libres.html>`__ :

Fourth day: non-technical contributions
---------------------------------------

A last day was dedicated to other contributions than coding. These are
more around the project, for example explanations, theoretical
fundamentals, etc.

A new mathematical demonstration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The morning has seen the demonstration by Stéphane Laborde, the author
of the RTM (Relativity Theory of Money), that a currency with a given
rate of money creation and providing a Basic Income to its people by
using a tax \ **have an equivalent Freedom currency** that only uses
money creation. This mathematical demonstration can be found in the last
version of the RTM in this file: \ `Relativity Theory of Money
(french) <http://trm.creationmonetaire.info/TheorieRelativedelaMonnaie.pdf>`__.

Presentation of David Chazalviel: "The RTM in color" and "The RTM for the kids"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`David Chazalviel <http://cuckooland.free.fr/index.html>`__ gave us a
presentation about his 2 last contributions for spreading about Freedom
Money:

**The RTM in color**
(`english <http://cuckooland.free.fr/TheRtmInColor.html>`__ or
`french <http://cuckooland.free.fr/LaTrmEnCouleur.html>`__ version) is a
brilliant web application to simulate and explore the concepts of a
Freedom Money.

**The RTM for the kids** (available in
`french <http://cuckooland.free.fr/LaTrmPourLesEnfants.html>`__ only)
is an interactive presentation trying to explain what is a Freedom Money
and the RTM to kids, thanks to Elise and its fairy friend:

Subscription to metab\_brouzouf currency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The afternoon was the occasion for people to try Cutecoin
and \ `subscribe to metab\_brouzouf
currency <http://forum.ucoin.io/t/subscribing-to-meta-brouzouf-testing-currency>`__!
As you can see, we now are about 23 active members testing uCoin:

Conclusion
----------

This 1st edition of 2015 FMM was a very successful meeting with a lot of
new people met and introduced to money codes, many technical
details were explained and **the very first client applications**
Cutecoin & uCoinApps have been presented and tested by final users! What
will await us for `next FMM in Valence during November
2015 <https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Valence/@44.8679005,4.9135516,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47f55799c63221c7:0x408ab2ae4bfb580>`__? Coming
months will tell us, but be sure a lot of work is to be achieved until
then!
